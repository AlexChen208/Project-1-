// Create a function that checks for pairs
    // Grab firstClick and store value while revealing the color
    // Grab secondCLick and store the value while revealing the color
        // Also remove click function so that people can't spam any clicks
            // If colors don't match, bring back cover that hides the color
                // 1) set up timer so that user has time to memorize the color
                // 2) make sure to have clicks back to empty string so that value isn't stored at the same click
                // 3) enable click function again
            // else cards do match, have a class name matched to know that the cards do match
                // set clicks back to empty string, don't store previous data
                // enable click function
                // apply win/loss logic at the bottom to keep track of score

// Create a timer for the game
    // Calculate the time that I want to show on the timer and how many seconds to go down at a time
    // If time reaches zero, end the game

//  Create win/loss logic
    // If won is true
        // Print winner
    // else
        // print loser
